SL Dance HUD

The original purpose is to keep dance animations. After a while other features where added. Unfortunately I abandoned the software long ago and just realized that never really published it. I thought there were some good ideas pertinent to the LSL language; feel free to borrow those ideas or even offer constructive critizism. Those ideams might awaken my desire to further develop the script.

I am a Unix geek so my special favorite feature is the welth of command line options. One of my presona favorites is the ability to invite someone to dance under your HUD by simply typing their name partially. The invite will be sent to the closest avatar matching the partial word.

I will do my best to describe what is currently avaiable. Also, I would like to create files to accompnay each script. I am a documentation freak. Unfortunately, due to the nature of scripts in SL the comments within the script can contribute to the lag of the software.

Here is a description of what is currently available:

1. Unlimited number of categories
2. My special flavor of a titler, (used to be popular back in the day)
3. You can offer exclusive invites
4.
